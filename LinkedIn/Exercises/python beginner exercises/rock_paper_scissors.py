# Rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say ‚Äúrock, paper, scissors‚Äù and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The rules are straightforward:
# Rock smashes scissors.
# Paper covers rock.
# Scissors cut paper.

# We‚Äôd like you to replicate this game using Python! Requirements:
# Allow user to choose Rock, Paper or Scissors
# Allow the computer to randomly generate a response
# Determine who wins the game
# This can be done in any way that is comfortable with you but we would like to see you demonstrate the various concepts learnt through the courses already.

# Bonus points üëÄ
# Extend the playability by allowing the user to play several games in a row (user input for how many games to play in a row)
# Improve the readability of the code using Enums and functions
# Add additional features to increase the overall experience of the game.
